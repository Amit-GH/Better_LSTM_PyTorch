We can use conda environment to manage dependencies for this project.

The python environment can be recreated using the `environment.yml` file present in the directory.
To clone the python environment, you can use the `spec-file.txt`.

The instructions for using both the files are in Conda usage documentation [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).
